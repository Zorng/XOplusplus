# Project: XO++

**Description:** XO++ is a more exciting and thrilling of the orignal XO(Tic Tac Toe). XO++ has 3 play modes such as,
- Classic: The original Tic Tac Toe with winning options such as 3 to win and 5 to win
- Best of 5: The first player to score 3 lines wins. Play continously without resetting the board after each score
- Portal: A 4x4 board with portal on the vertical and horizontal sides.

To make it more fun and less boring to play, the *Rapid* option can be enabled. With this option enabled each player has 5 seconds to play their turns. If a player does not make a move during that 5 seconds, that player loses.

**Tools:** JavaFX for graphic and interaction with mouse
